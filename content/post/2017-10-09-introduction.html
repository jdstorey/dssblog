<div id="yet-another-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>Yet another blog</h1>
<p>Some of the most useful and inspiring research related ideas I’ve come across the last few years I found on blogs rather than in traditional publications. Blogs provide an opportunity to communicate ideas quickly, concisely, and with the flexibility and portability of a web site. I’ve benefitted tremendously from the time and effort that others have put into their blogs. I also find myself increasingly wanting to share ideas, tips, or examples that are best suited for a blog. So it’s time for me to jump in and try to contribute to the blogosphere!</p>

<div id="topics-i-plan-to-write-about" class="section level1">
<h1>Topics I plan to write about</h1>
<p>Here are some topics I hope to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data science as a field</li>
<li>Key concepts in statistics</li>
<li>Problems in genomics I’m excited about</li>
<li>How I’ve taught two courses using R Markdown</li>
<li>Techniques I use when analyzing data</li>
<li>Data visualization approaches</li>
<li>Tutorials on R packages I’ve developed</li>
<li>Mixed martial arts analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>I may also throw in a post occasionally that has nothing to do with data or science.</p>

<div id="how-i-created-this-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>How I created this blog</h1>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a>, which utilizes <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> to create websites using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. I’ll therefore be able to include reproduicble R code and its output within my blog posts. For example…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;RXKCD&quot;)
getXKCD(552)</code></pre>
